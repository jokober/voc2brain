# Voc2brain
Voc2brain is a vocabulary trainer with concept of allowing users to learn words in an easy and efficient way. The software assists users with retaining as much knowledge as possible.

The key method Voc2brain uses is the flashcard system structuring learning around your
schedule. After each testing, the words go one level further until they reach the seventh level. The interval inbetween the intestings increases with the advancing to a higher level. Is a vocabulary answered in a wrong way though, it goes back to the first level. With this system, a temporary learning of words is prevented and languages are learned continuous and efficient.
